# 🔐 Smart Contract Integration Guide

## Current Status

The app has **TWO payment implementations**:

### 1. Direct Transfer (PaymentButton.tsx) - ❌ Not using smart contract
- Sends tokens directly to admin wallet
- No escrow, no refund mechanism
- **This is the current implementation**

### 2. Smart Contract Escrow (SmartPaymentButton.tsx) - ✅ Proper implementation
- Uses smart contract with escrow
- Funds held until service completed
- Admin confirms/refunds mechanism
- **This should be used instead**

## Problem

**PaymentButton.tsx** is sending tokens directly to your admin wallet, bypassing the smart contract. This means:
- ❌ No escrow protection
- ❌ No refund mechanism  
- ❌ Admin must manually handle refunds
- ❌ Funds go straight to admin

## Solution

**Switch to using SmartPaymentButton** which calls the smart contract:

### How the Smart Contract Works:

1. **User Pays** → Funds held in escrow (smart contract)
2. **ClubKonnect Processes** → Service delivery attempted
3. **If SUCCESS** → Admin confirms → Funds released to admin
4. **If FAILED** → Admin refunds → Funds returned to user
5. **If EXPIRED** → Auto-refund after 30 minutes

### Flow:

```
User Wallet
    ↓
Smart Contract (Escrow)
    ↓
[Funds Held]
    ↓
ClubKonnect API
    ↓
    ├─ SUCCESS → Admin confirms → Admin receives funds
    └─ FAIL → Admin refunds → User gets funds back
```

## Next Steps

You need to deploy the smart contract first. The contract addresses in the code are:
- packageId: `0x219eacf20c949bdc9587bc8a751c98ccf1c5be1084e8f17d8e80b09cf4636c63`
- contractId: `0xe32ef5c24070548d931428c37c654221ed537ea569b2cfc93638dbe078b2946e`

**Questions:**
1. Have you deployed the smart contract to testnet?
2. Do you want me to switch PaymentButton to use the smart contract?
3. Or do you prefer the direct transfer method (current)?
